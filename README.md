YOu will need

1) A 6x24 LED matrix made of 6, 24 LED long strips of NEOPixels (I suggest aliexpress for these)
2) An arduino with enough memory for the hilariously large non compressed arrays of pixel data for the purdy rainbows
3) A connected computer to run the serial controller interface in python
3b) Code and solder your own controller directly to the arduino (not hard only need 3 buttons(L, R, Fire)).
